You are provided a dataset that has been polluted.

 

Your job is to find as many of the polluted rows as you can. Polluted entries will be relatively intuitive. There are outliers as well. Entry formatting should be consistent (ex: 'Brooklyn', and 'Brkln, NYC' should not both be in the same column, as they mean the same thing). Data types should be consistent (it does not make sense to have both integer and decimal entries for a column such as 'minimum nights').

 

Follow the header format of SolutionTemplate.csv, where the first column is the ID, and the second column is the column in the dataset with the pollution. An optional third column is provided if you wish to provide a brief description of why the entry is incorrect (Do not create a unique description for each row, as you will find that the same description can be applied to many rows).

 

If a single row contains multiple polluted columns, this should be added as two different entries to the solution file.

 

For the third justification column, you can fill in some, all, or none of the rows. This column is purely optional, and is there to help settle interpretation disputes. It is highly recommended to fill out this column for partial credit purposes.

 

If your last name starts between A and I, use covid_19_set_1.csv
If your last name starts between J and R, use covid_19_set_2.csv
If your last name starts between S and Z, use covid_19_set_3.csv

 

The assignment files are all located under "Files".

You are required to submit 2 things. A csv with three columns like SolutionTemplate.csv, and your code.

 

Submit with a .csv format. The code file can be submitted in any reasonable format (.R, .ipynb, etc.).

 

 

Additional notes:

Active = Confirmed - Deaths - Recovered

Null entries in Province/State are not considered pollution

ID and Province/State are not polluted

If a row is missing entries across the entire row, you only need to report it once (leave the column category blank)

Don't worry about leading/trailing spaces

Don't worry about incorrect data types (If "1" is a string/char instead of an int, that's fine)

If an entire row is null, just report it once and put something along the lines of "all columns" for the column in your solution file
